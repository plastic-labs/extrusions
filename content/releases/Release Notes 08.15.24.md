## YouSim is Open Source!!!

Today we open sourceÂ [YouSim](https://yousim.ai/)!

Inspired byÂ [WorldSim](https://worldsim.nousresearch.com),Â [WebSim](https://websim.ai), &Â [Infinite Backrooms](https://dreams-of-an-electric-mind.webflow.io), YouSim leveragesÂ [Claude](https://claude.ai) 3.5 SonnetÂ to let you locate, modify, & interact with any entity you can imagine. It's an open-ended, CLI game (powered by [Honcho](https://honcho.dev)) that let's you simulate any possible identity.

Now you can fork, contribute, or host your own version of our identity simulator. Tweak the models, interface, prompting, or cognitive architecture to see how far we can collectively push the boundaries of the latent space.
