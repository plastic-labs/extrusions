## About the Role
We're searching for a founding engineer to help build the future of Plastic. That means actively iterating on the current version of [Honcho](https://honcho.dev) while co-creating the next version of our novel user represenation networking infrastructure and what lies beyond.

This role requires a full-stack engineer who can architect, build, and maintain complex systems from the ground up. That involves making critical technical decisions across the entire stack, from crafting intuitive user interfaces to designing robust backend systems, and managing cloud deployments. More than that, Plastic has several active projects, so context switching acumen is a must.

It's an opportunity for high-agency problem solving at multiple layers of abstraction. We need someone passionate about owning projects end-to-end with a track record of successfully deploying and maintaining production systems. If you're excited by solving problems at the edge, learning on the fly, and searing your mark into fundamentally new technological paradigms, let's talk.
