## About the Role

We're searching for a founding engineer to help build the future of Plastic. As a key technical leader, you'll work directly with the CTO to architect and implement Honcho, our distributed user representation infrastructure, while co-creating the next generation of decentralized AI agent coordination systems.

This role requires a systems-oriented engineer who can architect, build, and maintain complex distributed systems from the ground up. You'll make critical technical decisions across the entire stack, from designing scalable distributed architectures to implementing robust backend systems and managing cloud deployments. You'll also help shape our technical strategy around distributed consensus, network reliability, and system scalability.

While distributed systems expertise is core to this role, we need a versatile technical leader who can fill gaps wherever needed. You'll be responsible for end-to-end ownership of projects, from high-level architecture to hands-on implementation. If you're excited by solving complex distributed systems challenges, can think deeply about system design, and want to help define fundamentally new technological paradigms, let's talk.
