## About the Role
We're searching for an applied machine learning engineer excited to work on the ML side of [Honcho](https://honcho.dev). You'll work alongside our interdisciplinary team to transform novel ideas into production systems that help LLMs understand and align with individual users.

This role requires a strong engineer who rapidly prototypes and ships ML systems. The pace of the LLM space is staggering--we need someone with a hacker mentality who eagerly dives into papers/codebases and implements novel methods at breakneck speed to figure out what actually works. 

Our team is small and fast-moving, so you'll have the freedom to experiment widely and deploy impactful features quickly.

## About You
- 2-3 years applied LLM experience or equivalent
- NYC-based or open to NYC relocation
- Proficiency with a popular Python ML library (e.g PyTorch, TF, JAX, HF transformers, etc)
- Experience building LLM systems
- Experience with post-training methods & implementing LLM papers
- Comfortable in Unix environment + attendant command line tools (Git, Docker, etc)
- Up to date on OS AI community & technologies 
- High cultural alignment with Plastic Labs' ethos
- Complementary interest or experience specific to reinforcement learning, representation engineering, control vectors, prompt optimization, sparse auto-encoders, agentic frameworks, emergent behaviors, theory of mind, identity, a plus
- Complementary background in cognitive sciences (cs, linguistics, neuroscience, philosophy, psychology, etc) or other adjacent interdisciplinary, a plus
