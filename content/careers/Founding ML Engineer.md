(NYC, Full-Time)

## About the Role
We're seeking an exceptional ML engineer/leader who can architect breakthrough systems while staying immersed in cutting-edge research. You'll shape the AI direction of Plastic Labs directly with the CEO, tackling challenges across the entire machine learning stack.

This role demands someone who thrives at the intersection of research and engineering--someone who can read and reproduce state-of-the-art papers, design novel architectures, and transform promising experiments into production-ready systems. You'll move fluidly between theoretical frameworks and practical implementation, making intuitive decisions about model architecture, quantization strategies, and serving infrastructure.

We need a technical polymath who excels across the ML stack: from designing systematic experiments and running rigorous evaluations to building robust data pipelines and scalable model serving/inference systems. You should be particularly adept with post-training techniques that are redefining the field--from advanced inference-time computation methods to reinforcement learning with reasoning models. 

The LLM space moves at lightning speed, and so do we. You'll prototype rapidly while maintaining research rigor, implement robust MLOps practices, and craft observable systems that scale. Our small, interdisciplinary team moves fast--high agency is core to who we are. You'll have the freedom to directly impact our research and products to push the boundaries of what's possible in AI.

We're building systems that haven't been built before, solving problems that haven't been solved. If you're a technical leader who thrives on these challenges and can serve as our ML north star, we want you on our team.

## About You
- 3+ years of applied ML experience with deep LLM expertise
- Strong command of a popular Python ML library (e.g PyTorch, TF, JAX, HF transformers, etc)
- Experience replicating research papers soon after publication
- Experience building and scaling robust inference systems
- Practical experience with post-training and inference-time techniques (RL a plus)
- Ability to build reliable MLOps pipelines that perform under load
- Proficiency with Unix environments and developer tools (Git, Docker, etc.)
- Up-to-date with the Open Source AI community and emerging technologies
- Self-directed with a bias toward rapid execution
- High cultural alignment with Plastic Labs' ethos
- Based in NYC or willing to relocate
- Driven to push language models beyond conventional boundaries
- Background in cognitive sciences (CS, linguistics, neuroscience, philosophy, psychology) or related fields a plus


## How to Apply
Please send the following to research@plasticlabs.ai:
- **Resume/CV** in whatever form it exists (PDF, LinkedIn, website, etc)
- **Portfolio** of notable work (GitHub, pubs, ArXiv, blog, X, etc)
- **Statement** of alignment specific to Plastic Labs--how do you identify with our mission, how can you contribute, etc? (points for brief, substantive, heterodox)

Applications without these 3 items won't be considered, but be sure to optimize for speed over perfection. If relevant, be sure to credit the LLM you used.

And it can't hurt to [join Discord](https://discord.gg/plasticlabs) and introduce yourself or engage with [our GitHub](https://github.com/plastic-labs).
