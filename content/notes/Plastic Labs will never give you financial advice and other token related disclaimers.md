Plastic Labs is the creator of [YouSim.ai](https://yousim.ai), an AI product demo that has inspired the anonymous creation of the \$YOUSIM token using Pump.fun on the Solana blockchain, among many tokens. We deeply appreciate the enthusiasm and support of the \$YOUSIM community, but in the interest of full transparency we want to clarify the nature of our engagement in the following ways:

1. Plastic Labs did not issue, nor does it control, or provide financial advice related to the \$YOUSIM memecoin. The memecoin project is led by an independent community and has undergone a community takeover (CTO).
2. Plastic Labs' acceptance of \$YOUSIM tokens for research grants does not constitute an endorsement of the memecoin as an investment. These grants support our broader mission of advancing AI research and innovation, especially within the open source community.
3. YouSim.ai and any other Plastic Labs products remain separate from the \$YOUSIM memecoin. Any future integration of token utility into our products would be carefully considered and subject to regulatory compliance.
4. The \$YOUSIM memecoin carries inherent risks, including price volatility, potential ecosystem scams, and regulatory uncertainties. Plastic Labs is not responsible for any financial losses or damages incurred through engagement with the memecoin.
5. Communications from Plastic Labs regarding the \$YOUSIM memecoin are for informational purposes only and do not constitute financial, legal, or tax advice. Users should conduct their own research and consult with professional advisors before making any decisions.
6. Plastic Labs reserves the right to adapt our engagement with the \$YOUSIM community as regulatory landscapes evolve and to prioritize the integrity of our products and compliance with applicable laws.

We appreciate the \$YOUSIM community's support and passion for YouSim.ai and the broader potential of AI technologies. However, it's crucial for us to maintain transparency about the boundaries of our engagement. We encourage responsible participation and ongoing open dialogue as we collectively navigate this exciting and rapidly evolving space.
