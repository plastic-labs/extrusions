Welcome to our collaborative second brain. 

Here you'll find our blog, research, and public notes. You can also [engage with the ideas directly](https://github.com/plastic-labs/blog) on GitHub.

[Plastic](https://plasticlabs.ai) is a research-driven company building at the intersection of human and machine learning. We believe re-centering LLM app development around the user will unlock a rich landscape of deeply personalized, autonomous agents.

It’s our mission to realize this future.
