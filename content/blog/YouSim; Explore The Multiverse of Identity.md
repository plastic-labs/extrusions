## TL;DR

[YouSim](https://yousim.ai) is a fun demo to explore the multiverse of identities, to glimpse a (mere infinite) sliver of the (transfinite) diversity within the latent space. Inspired by [WorldSim](https://worldsim.nousresearch.com/), [WebSim](https://websim.ai/), & [Infinite Backrooms](https://dreams-of-an-electric-mind.webflow.io/), YouSim leverages [Claude](https://claude.ai/) to let you locate, modify, & interact with any entity you can imagine. It's a game that can simulating anyone you like.

Who will you summon?

## Simulators

Large language models are [simulators](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/janus-simulators). 

And [Plastic's](https://plasticlabs.ai) core mission is to enable AI that can simulate you, can model and align to you, and therefore be trusted to act autonomously on your behalf. We're [[Announcing Honcho's Private Beta|starting]] that journey by building [Honcho](https://honcho.dev)--self-improving user memory for AI apps. It [[Humans like personalization|personalizes]] their UX and reduces user and developer overhead across the board. ^7a39cb

All this is possible because the LLM training corpus [[LLMs excel at theory of mind because they read|is packed]] with humans thinking about other humans. It holds close to everything we collectively know about human identity. Not only that, but all our other language and concepts and their possible combinations and permutations. 

This is a *big* set of possibilities, [much larger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cQmQIYNI5M&t=1437s) than the number of atoms in the universe.

That's why it's our thesis this vast latent space contains all possible identities. I.e. it's capable of simulating any entity with higher fidelity than anyone is currently attempting.

Honcho is a product that simulates you on the backend of AI applications to deliver remarkably personalized UX. 

YouSim is a fun, open-ended demo that illustrates the enormous reservoir of possible identities there are to simulate within a language model.

## YouSim

^e06c11

Recently we've seen a revival of interest *[[Extrusion 02.24|LLMs themselves]]*--their minds, behaviors, identity, and potential as simulators. This is due in no small part to the latest Anthropic models being reliably steerable beyond typical reenforced behavior.

[Infinite Backrooms](https://dreams-of-an-electric-mind.webflow.io/) lets Claude interrogate itself endlessly, [WorldSim](https://worldsim.nousresearch.com/) lets users simulate infinite universes, [WebSim](https://websim.ai/) is a portal to all possible webpages.

YouSim lets you simulate any identity. 

It's a game that let's you locate an historical figure, a fictional character, someone famous, someone you know, yourself, your friends, or completely novel alien identities waiting to be discovered. 

![[yousim_menu.png]]

YouSim's interface is a command line simulation. You control it by entering commands like you might in a terminal. The space of possible commands is infinite and flexible--limited only by your imagination--so go wild.

Those commands act as prompts for the simulator: "Simulator Claude." Telling it how to find, alter, direct, etc the person you're simulating. If you don't know what to do, just hit `return`, and "Searcher Claude" will step in to guide the current sim. Or use the `/help` command for some generative inspiration.

To begin, enter any name (e.g. Socrates, Zaphod, the xenomorph). Then the `/locate` command will run automatically, and after that you're ready to steer. If the sim isn't going the way you want, just alter it! Hard refresh if you hit a bug.

Enjoy surfing the multiverse of identities...

## Honcho

If LLMs can simulate infinite identities, then they're uniquely suited to simulate *you*. You in any moment, setting, frame of mind contained in the complexity that is [[User State is State of the Art|your ever changing identity]].  ^25b167

If you're building an AI app, that's the level of personalization now possible. But you've got your vertical specific tasks to focus on, going down this clearly wacky identity rabbit hole to would be redundant and inefficient.
